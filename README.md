This is a group capstone project for an Android Development class. I contributed towards creating the Search Fragment, which shows the entirety of the inventory
in a recycler view. Said inventory can be filtered using the search bar, which could query by multiple fields without having to specify which field the user
is searching for. I also contributed towards implementing banner ads using Google's Admob.
